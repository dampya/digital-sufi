        <h1>Scoundrel</h1>
        <h3>A solitaire rogue-like card game by Zach Gage and Kurt Bieg.</h3>

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>Fight through a dungeon built from a standard deck of cards, managing health, weapons, and monsters.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deck setup: remove Jokers, all red face cards (J/Q/K Diamonds/Hearts), and red Aces (A Diamonds/Hearts). Shuffle the rest.</li>
          <li>Card roles: Clubs/Spades are Monsters (value 2–14), Diamonds are Weapons (value 2–10), Hearts are Potions (value 2–10).</li>
          <li>Room: reveal until 4 face up. You may avoid (place all 4 on bottom). You cannot avoid twice in a row.</li>
          <li>Turn: if you don’t avoid, you must resolve exactly 3 of the 4 cards, one by one, leaving 1 for next Room.</li>
          <li>Weapons: binding; equipping discards the previous weapon and all monsters stacked on it.</li>
          <li>Potions: heal up to 20; only one per turn. A second potion that turn is discarded with no effect.</li>
          <li>Combat with weapon: stack the monster on the weapon. You take max(0, monster − weapon) damage.</li>
          <li>Weapon restriction: after a weapon slays a monster of value X, it can only be used on monsters of value ≤ X next.</li>
          <li>Game end: when health ≤ 0 or you reach the end of the dungeon.</li>
          <li>Scoring on death: subtract the values of all remaining monsters in deck and room from your current health (result is negative score).</li>
          <li>Scoring on success: your life is your score, except if your life is 20 and your last card was a heart, add that potion’s value.</li>
        </ul>
